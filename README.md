Description
   This Node.js project, developed using the Express framework, is a scalable and maintainable foundation that combines the power of Dependency Injection (DI) principles with the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The application is designed to provide robust functionality for user and driver management, featuring APIs for user registration, driver registration, user login, and fetching driver profiles.
Key Features
    User and Driver Functionality:

    The project caters to two primary roles: "user" and "driver." It provides comprehensive APIs for user registration and login, as well as driver registration and profile retrieval.
    Dependency Injection Emphasis:

    With a strong emphasis on Dependency Injection (DI) principles, the project achieves loose coupling between components. This design choice promotes modularity, testability, and maintainability, making it easier to extend and modify the system.
    Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Approach:

    Following the principles of Domain-Driven Design, the application fosters a shared understanding of the problem domain between technical and domain experts. This approach facilitates effective communication and ensures that the software model aligns closely with real-world business concepts.
    Clear Separation of Concerns:

    The project's folder architecture demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, with dedicated directories for components such as controllers, repositories, services, and dependency injection containers. This structure enhances code organization and readability.
    Scalability and Maintainability:

    The project's design principles contribute to scalability and maintainability. As the system grows, the modular architecture allows for the addition of new features and modifications without introducing unintended side effects.
